"For the bird counters"

The general questions we are trying to answer are, "what are the geographic, socioeconomic, or climatic correlates of different types of CBC participation and effort? Is it possible to model and predict participation and effort?".  Keep in mind that some years, counts could be cancelled due to nasty weather. There will not be a record for that count during that year.  Field counters, parties, hours, and distances make up the largest chunks of effort and are the most interesting to us.

Also â€“ here is a description of the data that may help as well (in among other data types):
